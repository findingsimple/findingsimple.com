          <Tool title="My peak productivity hours">
            9:30 a.m to 3:00 p.m - outside of those there is usually something encroaching on my time whether it be kids, appointments or just brain fog and it’s time for some fresh air.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="I focus best when">
            I have a clear goal, minimal distractions, and caffeine.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="I prefer working">
            A mix of solo deep work with bursts of collaboration.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Ideal work environment">
            Calm, focused, async-friendly. I like to work from coffee shops or my own office space. <br/>
            Open plan spaces are not my jam - I get conscious of annoying others and others annoying me. <br/>
            I’m good at ignoring and/or leaving and ignoring Slack channels with low signal to noise. If something is important enough that I need to know about it, it will make its way to me.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="How I like to process information">
            Written is best - I love context - the more the merrier. I often refer back to notes or docs.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Things that help me get into flow">
            Good coffee, a solid to-do list, and some chill background music (or the gurgle of my aquariums).
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Things that disrupt my flow">
            Meetings that could have easily been an email.<br/>
            Vague requests or no context.<br/>
            Pointless pings or disruptions during my peak productivity hours.
          </Tool>
        </ToolsSection>
        <ToolsSection title="Communication Style">
          <Tool title="Preferred communication channels">
            Slack for quick things.<br/>
            Docs for structured info.<br/>
            Email for external stuff.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Response time expectations">
            I usually respond within a few hours during work hours, unless I’m in deep focus mode.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Follow-up preferences">
            Nudges are fine. I appreciate gentle reminders.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Preferred tone">
            Friendly and casual, but clear. I like a bit of personality in my messages.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="My approach to meetings">
            If it doesn’t have an agenda, it probably could’ve been async. I’m more than happy to do async chats.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Sorry in advance…">
            If my accent or Australian-ism’s get confusing. I try hard to not use slang and articulate clearly but can get to casual sometimes - please just ask me to repeat or clarify.

            I’m loyal and hardworking.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="What I appreciate in teammates">
            People who take ownership, share ideas early, and care about the “why” as much as the “how.”
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="How I handle conflict">
            Calmly and directly. I’ll suggest a chat to clarify and realign.

          <Tool title="Common misconceptions about me">
            I’m an introvert at heart.<br/>
            I like time to digest information and formulate responses. So I come across as chill or quiet. I just process before I speak.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="How to build trust with me">
            Communicate clearly, do what you say you will, and be kind.<br/>

          <Tool title="Meeting etiquette I value">
            Be on time, come prepared, and leave with clear actions.<br/>
